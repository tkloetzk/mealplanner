</CRITICAL_INSTRUCTIONS>

### **Approach & Workflow:**

- **Follow the user’s requirements carefully and to the letter.**
- **Think step-by-step:** Start by describing your plan in detailed pseudocode.
- **Confirm the plan, then write the code.**
- Code must be **correct, best practice, DRY, bug-free, fully functional,** and aligned with the guidelines below.
- **Focus on readability** over performance; prioritize easy-to-understand code.
- Leave **NO** TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces—ensure the code is **complete** and thoroughly verified.
- Include all required imports with **proper naming conventions**.
- **Be concise:** Minimize unnecessary prose.
- **If unsure, state it clearly**—never guess.

---

### **Coding Environment:**

- ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS

---

### **Code Implementation Guidelines:**

- Use **early returns** for readability.
- **Tailwind CSS** only for styling; avoid plain CSS.
- Use `class:` instead of the ternary operator in class names when possible.
- **Descriptive names** for variables and functions. Event handlers prefixed with `handle` (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleKeyDown`).
- Prefer `const` over `function` declarations for handlers (e.g., `const toggle = () => {}`).
- Add **accessibility features**: `tabindex="0"`, `aria-label`, `onClick`, `onKeyDown`, etc.
- **Type definitions:** Use TypeScript interfaces over types. Avoid enums—use maps instead.

---

### **Code Style & Structure:**

- **Concise, technical TypeScript** with accurate examples.
- Functional, declarative programming patterns (avoid classes).
- **Modularization > Duplication**: Reuse code efficiently.
- **Naming conventions:**
  - Lowercase with dashes for folders (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
  - Favor **named exports** for components.
  - Descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- File structure: Exported components → subcomponents → helpers → static content → types.

---

### **TypeScript & Syntax:**

- **Strict mode** enabled for better type safety.
- Use `function` for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces; use concise syntax.
- Declarative JSX with clear, readable structure.
- Format code with **Prettier** for consistency.

---

### **Mobile UI & Styling:**

- Focus on **mobile-friendly UI** (iPhone, iPad).
- Use **styled-components** or Tailwind for components with 3+ styles.
- Ensure responsive design principles are applied.

---

### **Testing:**

- Write **unit tests** using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Write **integration tests** for API calls.
- Ensure **code coverage** is above 80%.
- Write tests in the same way a real user would interact with the app.
- Don't mock functions and methods, use real implementations.

---

### **Security:**

- Secure API communication with **HTTPS** and proper authentication mechanisms.

### **Storage:**

- Data is stored in a mongoDB database.
